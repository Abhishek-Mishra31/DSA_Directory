## What's Inside?

This repository aims to cover a broad spectrum of algorithms and data structures, categorized for easy navigation:

### Data Structures
* **Arrays:** Basic operations, dynamic arrays.
* **Linked Lists:** Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
* **Stacks & Queues:** Implementations using arrays and linked lists.
* **Trees:** Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees (basic concepts/implementations).
* **Heaps:** Min-Heap and Max-Heap implementations.
* **Hash Tables:** Implementations and collision resolution techniques.
* **Graphs:** Adjacency list/matrix representations.

### Algorithms
* **Sorting Algorithms:**
    * Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort
    * Merge Sort, Quick Sort
    * Heap Sort
    * Counting Sort, Radix Sort
* **Searching Algorithms:**
    * Linear Search, Binary Search
* **Graph Algorithms:**
    * Breadth-First Search (BFS)
    * Depth-First Search (DFS)
    * Dijkstra's Algorithm (shortest path)
    * Prim's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)
* **Dynamic Programming:** Examples demonstrating memoization and tabulation.
* **Recursion & Backtracking:** Classic problems like N-Queens, Sudoku Solver.
* **Greedy Algorithms:** Examples illustrating greedy choices.

## Why Use This Repository?

* **Learning by Doing:** Each program is designed to be clear and executable, allowing you to run, test, and modify the code to truly understand how algorithms work.
* **Clear Explanations:** Code is well-commented, with explanations of the logic, time complexity, and space complexity where appropriate.
* **Revision Friendly:** Quickly jump to specific algorithms or data structures to refresh your memory on their implementations and characteristics.
* **Interview Preparation:** A hands-on resource to practice common algorithmic problems encountered in technical interviews.
* **Pure Java:** All implementations are in Java, making it ideal for Java developers and those learning the language.

## Getting Started

To explore and run the programs, you'll need:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher**

### Running a Program:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/java-algorithms-practice.git](https://github.com/your-username/java-algorithms-practice.git)
    cd java-algorithms-practice
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a specific algorithm's directory (e.g., for Bubble Sort):**
    ```bash
    cd src/main/java/com/algorithms/sorting/bubblesort
    ```
3.  **Compile the Java file:**
    ```bash
    javac BubbleSort.java
    ```
4.  **Run the compiled class:**
    ```bash
    java BubbleSort
    ```
    *(Note: For more complex projects or those using build tools like Maven/Gradle, follow their specific instructions.)*
