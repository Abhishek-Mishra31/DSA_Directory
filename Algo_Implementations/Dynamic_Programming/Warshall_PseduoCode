Input: A[n][n]  — adjacency matrix of a graph with n vertices
Output: T[n][n] — transitive closure matrix

1. Initialize T = A
2. for k = 0 to n-1:
3.     for i = 0 to n-1:
4.         for j = 0 to n-1:
5.             T[i][j] = T[i][j] OR (T[i][k] AND T[k][j])
6. Return T



Time complexity : 0( n ^ 3 ) not sufficient as compare to dijkastra's algo
